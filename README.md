# photojav
Image filter application personal project
Made 4 years ago when I first started programming!

#Need to have at least an image saved on your computer as well as the file path to that specific image on your clipboard in order to test this program out. Photo must be a png or jpeg

  
Bugs:
  - All file names need to be four characters in order for this to work.
  - When choosing filter option, you have to type in one of the numbers, don't type out the filter name provided. Otherwise the program will make the image into grayscale by default
  - If the filepaths aren't valid, the program would continue to run and accept inputs, but throw
    javax.imageio.IIOException: Can't read input file!Exception in thread "main"

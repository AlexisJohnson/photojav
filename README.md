# photojav
Image filter application personal project


#Need to have at least an image saved on your computer as well as the file path to that specific image on your clipboard in order to test this program out. Photo must be a png or jpeg

  
TODO:
  - Ensure that file names can have more than 4 characters.
  - Ensure functionality when user types out more than 4 characters
  - If the filepaths aren't valid, the program would continue to run and accept inputs, but throw
    javax.imageio.IIOException: Can't read input file!Exception in thread "main"
